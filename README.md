# -Next-Word-Prediction-Model-Using-Python
The Next Word Prediction Model aims to build a Python-based language model using advanced machine learning techniques like transformers and RNNs. It processes large text datasets, cleans and extracts patterns (like n-grams), and is trained to accurately predict the next word based on context.
